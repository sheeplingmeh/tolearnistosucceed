Small little project doing some analysis for 4d numbers.
Considerations prior to starting:
1. There are no available public datasets for the 4d numbers. Therefore it is only possible to scrape them from the official website. This is strictly for learning purposes and there were no intention to violate any laws.

Steps taken:
1. Scrape website to obtain list of winning combinations the past 3 years.
2. Clean data if necessary.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis on dataset.
4. Create powerbi dashboard (for joys).
